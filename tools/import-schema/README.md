# Import Schema tool

This tool imports schema IDs for all items in itemnames.js.

## Notes

This tool was built only for internal use and needs several quality of life improvements.

It could be expanded to handle unusual effects, too.

## Usage

Before using this tool, use the import refs and translations tool to generate refs.

1. Run the html file (for example by using the Live Preview extension in VSCode). 
2. Load the items_game.txt file from TF2's files, located in "tf/scripts/items/items_game.txt"
3. Press "Assign item schema numbers"
4. Copy output to itemnames.js
